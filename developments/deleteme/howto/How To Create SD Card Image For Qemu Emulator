How To Create SD Card Image For Qemu Emulator


Introduction
    Qemu has great tools to manipulate disk images, but sometime it's not easy to know how to make the first one, the one that you have to make from 'outside' on the host.
    Here's a quick howto on how to make a fake SD card and use it in qemu.
    Note that this is very similar to the way one makes a real SD card.


Making the Image File
    qemu-img create ~/.xboot/sdcard.img 256M

    Then, make a "network block device" out of it. The process will sit in the background, and avcept just one connection on the port 1024 (default). See qemu-nbd --help for details.

    qemu-nbd ~/.xboot/sdcard.img &

    Now, we need to tell linux to "attach" itself to it, and create a virtual block device. First you need to have nbd-client installed on your linux, here's how to install it for ubuntu derivative

    sudo apt-get install nbd-client


Load the necessary kernel modules
    sudo modprobe nbd


Connect to the disk
    sudo nbd-client localhost 1024 /dev/nbd0


Partition the disk image
    sudo fdisk /dev/nbd0

    Note that the blocks device node are stay in /dev/mapper/nbd0p1 and /dev/mapper/nbd0p2 and so on.


Format partition
    sudo mkfs.vfat /dev/mapper/nbd0p1
    sudo mkfs.ext3 /dev/mapper/nbd0p2


Mount and umount block device
    sudo mount /dev/mapper/nbd0p1 /mnt
    sudo umount /mnt


Disconnect to the disk
    sudo nbd-client -d /deb/nbd0
